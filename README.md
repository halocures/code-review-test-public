# Code Review Challenge

**The task here is to imagine that the files in this repository are part of a new pull request and to leave a code review as you normally would. A few assumptions can be made:**
- All of the other files needed for the app to actually "work" already exist
- All of the necessary endpoints, actions, methods referenced in these files already exist, even if they aren't in the files (for example, a POST request to `/wishlist_items`)
- Although typically these would probably be split into multiple pull requests, for the sake of this exercise they can be grouped into one

<br />

**The "changes" being made in this pull request are:**
- Creates a Wishlist component that allows users to add and save books to their wishlist, as well as remove them with or without marking them as "owned"
- Creates a Stats page that displays information about a user's owned books
- Adds various Redux logic, Rails actions/methods, etc. These will have comments explaining the intended functionality.

<br />

**Instructions:**
- Clone this repository
- Review each file (aside from README.md), leaving comments in the code where you would normally do so in Github
- When you are done, zip these files and email them to andrew@halo.science
- After reviewing your comments, we will get in touch with you about next steps. Good luck!
